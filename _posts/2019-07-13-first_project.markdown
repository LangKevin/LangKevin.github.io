This first project was an enjoyable experience for me as screen scraping was defintely a new experience until several recent projects.  One of my biggest concerns however was trying to figure out what to design as I am not the most creative person in the world.  Driving into work one day after getting off a work call it all kind of came together with my idea.  As I was listening to a Pittsburgh sports talk radio show it made me think of something.  I enjoy Pittsburgh sports and what could I do with that?  I am a frequent visitor to espn and thought why dont I try to do something with this.  So my idea of listing out all 32 nfl teams then breaking down further info about each came to be.  The schedule page was a challenge and took the longest to develop against as there were several different areas of info that I needed from that page.  However after a little bit it all seemed to come together.  This was definitely something that I would have not pictured me doing several months ago and defintely liked doing it.  I can see me using this in the future as I am usually asking someone I work with who do the Steelers play next week and what time is the game.
