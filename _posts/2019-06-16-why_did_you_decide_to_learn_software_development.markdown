Why did you decide to learn software development?  I always found computers interesting since I was young along with an interest in history.  I decided to pursue a history major in college and ended up getting a teaching certification along the way.  After graduation I was having problems finding a full time job as a history teacher so then is when I realized that I should pursue the software development path.   I always was interested in that and that is how I ended up where I am at today.  Developing software can be extremely rewarding and extremely frustrating within the same day.  However with this being said it is a very enjoyable experience as there seem to be new challenges that you run into every day.  By the end of the day sometimes you feel like not thinking anymore however you have a sense of accomplishment by conquering something that was presented in front of you.  Looking back now I was fortunate that I didnt get that job at first so I could be involved in a career that I truly enjoy.
