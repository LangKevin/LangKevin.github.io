My sinatra project first challenge was just thinking of a project to create.  After getting my idea of what I wanted to do it did go faster than I thought it would.  I have always liked cars so it can to me to create a site where you can list cars to sell or be a buyer a but cars.  I had struggles with github twice and did lose code which was frustrating but overall I had fun creating this.  Creating this from scratch from the beginning to the end did have some frustrations but was easier than I expected which is a pleasnt surprise.  I did enjoy this one.
